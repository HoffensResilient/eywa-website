Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.
The Earth has music for those who listen.
Look deep into nature and then you will understand everything better.



To walk in nature is to witness a thousand miracles.
The Earth laughs in flowers.
Nature is the art of God.
Lightning is incredible.
Joy in looking and comprehending is nature’s most beautiful gift.
Taking pictures is savoring life intensely, every hundredth of a second
How glorious a greeting the sun gives the mountains!
The shoreline at sunset is simply….beautiful.



Just living is not enough…One must have sunshine, freedom and a little flower.
Keep your love of nature, for that, is the true way to understand art more and more.
Landscape photography is the supreme test of the photographer – and often the supreme disappointment.
The bird is powered by its own life and by its motivation.
Every sunset brings the promise of a new dawn.
Colors are the smiles of nature.
